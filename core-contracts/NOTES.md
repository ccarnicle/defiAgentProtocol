# Notes

These contracts are extracted from https://github.com/onflow/flow-core-contracts/tree/29940d8821f0c6751f451e59dd330c1765e93a97 to simplify cadence linting when using FlowCallbackScheduler because they are only deployed on the emulator and cannot be installed with flow deps install command.

The contracts are taken at the same commit used in the version of the flow emulator imported in the latest flow-cli project version. 

They don't need to be deployed because they are already in the emulator.
